Machine learning is transforming industries across the globe. From recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles, ML algorithms are becoming increasingly sophisticated and accessible.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled training data to make predictions on new, unseen data.

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without predefined labels.

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning agents learn through trial and error, receiving rewards for good actions.

## Popular Libraries

- **TensorFlow**: Google's open-source ML framework
- **PyTorch**: Facebook's dynamic neural network library
- **Scikit-learn**: Python's most popular ML library
- **Keras**: High-level neural network API

## Getting Started with Python

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load and prepare data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = data['target']

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

The field of machine learning is evolving rapidly, and staying updated with the latest developments is crucial for success in this domain.
