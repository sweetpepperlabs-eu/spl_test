In today's interconnected world, cybersecurity has become more critical than ever. Understanding the basics of digital security is essential for both individuals and organizations.

## Common Threats

### Malware
Malicious software designed to harm systems or steal data:
- **Viruses**: Self-replicating programs
- **Trojans**: Disguised malicious programs
- **Ransomware**: Encrypts files for ransom
- **Spyware**: Monitors user activity

### Social Engineering
Psychological manipulation to gain unauthorized access:
- **Phishing**: Fake emails or websites
- **Pretexting**: Creating false scenarios
- **Baiting**: Leaving infected devices in public
- **Quid pro quo**: Offering services for information

## Security Best Practices

### Password Security
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Use password managers
- Regularly update passwords

### Network Security
- Use encrypted connections (HTTPS, VPN)
- Keep software updated
- Use firewalls
- Monitor network traffic

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Regular backups
- Access control
- Data classification

## Encryption Basics

Encryption converts readable data into an unreadable format using algorithms and keys.

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

# Generate a key
key = Fernet.generate_key()
cipher_suite = Fernet(key)

# Encrypt data
text = "Sensitive information"
encrypted_text = cipher_suite.encrypt(text.encode())

# Decrypt data
decrypted_text = cipher_suite.decrypt(encrypted_text)
```

## Incident Response

1. **Preparation**: Develop response plans
2. **Identification**: Detect security incidents
3. **Containment**: Limit damage
4. **Eradication**: Remove threats
5. **Recovery**: Restore systems
6. **Lessons Learned**: Improve security

Cybersecurity is an ongoing process that requires constant vigilance and adaptation to new threats.
