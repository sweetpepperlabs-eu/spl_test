Blockchain technology has evolved far beyond its cryptocurrency origins, offering solutions for various industries including finance, supply chain, and digital identity.

## What is Blockchain?

A blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. Each block contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs, a record of that transaction is added to every participant's ledger.

## Key Features

### Decentralization
No single entity controls the network, making it resistant to censorship and single points of failure.

### Immutability
Once recorded, data cannot be altered without consensus from the network.

### Transparency
All transactions are visible to all participants in the network.

### Security
Cryptographic algorithms ensure the integrity and security of transactions.

## Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code.

```solidity
// Simple Ethereum smart contract
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint256 private storedData;
    
    function set(uint256 x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }
    
    function get() public view returns (uint256) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

## Popular Blockchains
