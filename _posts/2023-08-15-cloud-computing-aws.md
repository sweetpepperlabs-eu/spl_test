Amazon Web Services (AWS) has become the leading cloud computing platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally.

## Core AWS Services

### Compute
- **EC2**: Virtual servers in the cloud
- **Lambda**: Serverless computing
- **ECS**: Container orchestration
- **Elastic Beanstalk**: Platform as a Service

### Storage
- **S3**: Object storage
- **EBS**: Block storage for EC2
- **EFS**: File storage
- **Glacier**: Long-term archival storage

### Database
- **RDS**: Managed relational databases
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database
- **ElastiCache**: In-memory caching
- **Redshift**: Data warehouse

## Getting Started

1. **Create an AWS Account**
2. **Set up IAM Users and Roles**
3. **Configure AWS CLI**

```bash
aws configure
AWS Access Key ID: [Your Access Key]
AWS Secret Access Key: [Your Secret Key]
Default region name: us-east-1
Default output format: json
```

## Best Practices

### Security
- Use IAM roles instead of access keys
- Enable MFA for all users
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Regularly rotate credentials

### Cost Optimization
- Use reserved instances for predictable workloads
- Implement auto-scaling
- Monitor usage with CloudWatch
- Use spot instances for non-critical workloads

### Architecture
- Design for failure
- Implement multi-region deployments
- Use load balancers for high availability
- Implement proper monitoring and logging

Cloud computing has revolutionized how we build and deploy applications, making it easier than ever to scale globally.
